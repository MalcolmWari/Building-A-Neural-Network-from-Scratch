# Neural Network From Scratch

This repository contains the implementation of a neural network built entirely from scratch using Python. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the foundational concepts of neural networks, including layer design, forward propagation, and backpropagation algorithms, without relying on high-level libraries.

## Features

- **Pure Python Implementation**: No dependencies on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Detailed Comments**: Each step of the code is explained through comments to make it easier to understand.
- **Modular Design**: The neural network components are designed to be reusable and extendable.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (optional for matrix operations)
